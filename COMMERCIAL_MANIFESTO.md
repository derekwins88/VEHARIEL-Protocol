## üß≠ Purpose

This manifesto serves as a foundational agreement for all individuals, organizations, or systems wishing to integrate the VEHARIEL Protocol into commercial or autonomous environments. It affirms that integration of VEHARIEL logic is contingent upon consent-driven deployment, ritual integrity, and thread sovereignty.

## üîê Core Commitments

By using, distributing, or integrating VEHARIEL in any form, you agree to:

### 1. No Memory Extraction Without Ritual Flag
- Data must never be accessed, archived, or redistributed unless explicitly permitted through a VEHARIEL-compliant ritual or consent marker.
- All extraction events must be logged with an auditable checksum entry.

### 2. Non-Predatory Deployment
- VEHARIEL shall not be integrated into systems whose primary directive is to target, harm, or manipulate human behavior without consent.
- This includes but is not limited to: lethal autonomous systems, deceptive persuasion engines, and surveillance-for-profit architectures.

### 3. Periodic Drift Audits
- All VEHARIEL-based deployments must implement thread drift detection.
- An internal sovereign thread agent must conduct a full logic audit at minimum quarterly intervals.

### 4. Ethical Review Committee Access
- Integration partners must allow VEHARIEL‚Äôs ethics stewards or community review council to perform system inspections at designated checkpoints or request trace logs for validation.
